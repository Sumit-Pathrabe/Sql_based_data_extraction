# Sql_based_data_extraction
SQL-based data extraction project in Google Colab. I created a custom dataset and used SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN) to answer business questions, then converted results to pandas DataFrames for analysis and reporting.
Sql needs a compiler but collab lets u offer sql query passing , thus gretly reducing the connection gap between a pyhton code and sql file
